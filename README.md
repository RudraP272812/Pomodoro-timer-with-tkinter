# Pomodoro Timer

## Description:

This Python application implements a timer based on the Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The Pomodoro Technique uses timed intervals to break down work into focused sessions separated by short breaks, promoting focused productivity.

## Features:

- **Work and Break Timings:** Set customizable durations for work sessions and breaks (short and long).
- **Timer Controls:** Start, pause, and reset the timer to manage your work intervals effectively.
- **Session Tracking:** Keep track of completed work sessions with checkmarks displayed dynamically.
- **Visual Representation:** A clear and visually appealing interface with a tomato image (traditionally associated with the Pomodoro Technique) and a timer display.
